Hello👋👋 This is my reposytory, i will commit all my work with REST-API here.

If you want to run the file, paste this into the command line: php -S localhost:8080 main.php

IMPORTANT: You must run this in the directory where the main.php file is located.!!!!!

To run this program, you need to download composer and write composer install in the directory console.
